README for the pdf-conv directory
---------------------------------

This is a version of the PDFevln package that additionally provides a
f77 interface to allow a simple determination of convolutions of
splitting functions with a given pdf set. This is useful in various
contexts such as inclusion of factorization scale dependence in
a-posteriori inclusion of PDFs for jet calculations; or for matching
between fixed-order and resummed calculations.

To see what routines are available, and which other parameters are
around, examine src/f77_pdftab.f90

Note that compilation requires a fortran 90 compiler -- those that
have been tested (to varying extents) include ifort, lf95, g95 and
gfortran, some of which (all but lf95) are available freely to varying
extents; for initialisation g95 is found to be quite a bit slower than
the other compilers.

Complaints and questions should be addressed to
Gavin Salam <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

On request the f77 interface may be extended to include easy access to
the evolution part of the package.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# To compile library:
#-------------------
> cd src
# edit fortran 90 compiler in Makefile if need be
> make 

# then to compile example program
#--------------------------------
> cd ../example_f77
# edit Makefile so as to include the appropriate f90 and LHAPDF libraries
> make 

# then run it as follows and check output against what is below
> ./convolution_example
